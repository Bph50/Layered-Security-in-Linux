# Layered-Security-in-Linux
Overview

Layered security, also known as defense in depth, is a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that involves multiple layers of protection to safeguard systems, networks, and data. This strategy ensures that if one layer of defense is breached, additional layers continue to provide security.

Components of Layered Security
> Physical Security: Protects the physical infrastructure, including servers, data centers, and other hardware, from unauthorized access and physical threats.

> Endpoint Security: Secures individual devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets from cyber threats. This includes antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

> Security Architecture: Involves designing and implementing a secure framework for IT systems, ensuring that security measures are integrated into the overall system architecture.

> Antivirus & Antimalware: Protects systems from malicious software, including viruses, worms, and ransomware, by detecting and removing these threats.

> Server System Security: Focuses on securing server environments, including operating systems and applications, to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

> Attack Vectors: Identifies and mitigates potential pathways through which attackers can gain access to systems, such as phishing, malware, and network vulnerabilities.

> Link Verification: Ensures that links and URLs are safe and not leading to malicious sites, protecting users from phishing and other online threats.
